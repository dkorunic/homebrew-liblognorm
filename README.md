# Homebrew Formulae

A [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for:

  * [liblognorm](http://www.liblognorm.com/): a log normalizing library
  * [libfastjson](https://github.com/rsyslog/libfastjson): a fast json library for C


## Usage

Using these formulas requires Homebrew, which in turn requires Xcode. If you have not yet installed Homebrew, take a look [how to do so](https://brew.sh/).

Tap this repository once homebrew is installed:

```shell
brew tap dkorunic/homebrew-liblognorm
```

To install liblognorm, just use `brew install` with the following formulas:

```shell
brew install libfastjson
brew install liblognorm
```
